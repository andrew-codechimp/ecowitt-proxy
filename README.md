# github.com/sesopenko/ecowitt-proxy

Receives Ecowitt api calls and proxies them to multiple locations.  I built this project so I could integrate my Ecowitt
with multiple systems, despite my Ecowitt gateway only allowing one custom endpoint.

Point the endpoint to the proxy, configure the proxy for multiple proxied hosts, and that's it.

## Setup

1. Copy `config.example.yml` to `config.yml` and enter your own details.
